# About this book

If you want to learn how to use Git without worrying too much about what's going
on under the hood, then this book is for you.

Every chapter will take something that Git can do for you---from tracking
changes, to searching your files, to collaborating with others---and explain
practically how to achieve that goal. We won't cover everything Git can do, but
we won't just stick to the basics either: the goal of this book is to teach you
a working set of Git commands that can get you through most day-to-day
situations.

If you're learning Git for the first time, I'd recommend reading through in
order: When we look at a particular goal, I'll assume knowledge of commands that
were covered in earlier chapters.

\mainmatter

\part{Getting started}

# Goal: Get set up

## What is Git?

Git is a <dfn>version control system</dfn>. When you work on a project---whether
it's a piece of software, a Web site, a book, or anything else that goes through
many revisions---using version control lets you track the changes that you make,
return to previous versions, try alternative ideas, and seamlessly merge your
own work with the work of others.

Git can track any kind of files, but it's best suited to <dfn>plain text
files</dfn>. If you're not familiar with the term, these are files that just
contain unformatted text as opposed to images or things like
<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>.

## Using the command line

Everything covered in this book will be done from the command line. While there
are various applications that provide graphical interfaces for Git, the command
line interface is powerful, flexible, and works on every platform. Issuing
commands, one-by-one, forces us to take things step-by-step so we can really
understand what's happening.

If you're not familiar with using command line tools, then there are a few terms
you'll need to know. Here's a typical Git command:

    git commit --message "My first commit"

We'll cover what it does later, but for now let's name its component parts:

* `git` is the <dfn>command</dfn>: it's the name of the program we want to run.
* `commit` is the <dfn>sub-command</dfn>: it tells Git what we want it to do.
  Not all command line interfaces use sub-commands, but since Git uses them for
  almost everything, in the context of this book we can just think of
  `git commit` as the command.
* `--message` and `"My first commit"` are both <dfn>arguments</dfn>: they are
  passed to the command to further nuance its behaviour. Arguments often come in
  pairs, where we tell Git what option we want to use---in this case
  `--message`---and then a value for that option---`"My first commit"`.

## Installing and configuring Git

Before we begin, you'll need to install Git and get it set up:

1.  Go to the Git downloads page, and follow the instructions for your operating
    system: [http://git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  Make sure you can run Git commands from the command line. If you're on Mac
    OS X you can use the Terminal.app application; if you're on Windows there's
    an application called <i>Git Bash</i> that comes with Git.

    The following command should tell you what version of Git you have installed:

        $ git --version
        git version 2.2.1

    As with all of the examples in this book, the `$` at the beginning of
    the line indicates that this is a command; you shouldn't include it in the
    command you type.

    If you see a version number, as show above, then Git is installed
    successfully. If you see a message along the lines of `command not found`,
    then Git isn't correctly installed yet.
3.  When Git is tracking changes to our files, it needs to know who made those
    changes---we'll see why this is important when we explore Git's
    collaborative features in Part 4.

    To identify yourself, and therefore the changes you track with Git, you
    need to set Git's `user.name` and `user.email` settings with the following
    commands, replacing my name and email address with your own:

        $ git config --global user.name "George Brocklehurst"
        $ git config --global user.email george@georgebrock.com

    The `--global` argument tells Git that these settings should apply to
    all of the Git projects you work on, so you'll only need to set this once.
    Don't worry if you don't completely follow this now; we'll talk about the
    `git config` command in more detail later in the book.

# Goal: Track changes

If you can see how the incremental changes to your files led to their current
state, then you have a better chance of understanding the project you are
working on, fixing problems that arise, and collaborating successfully with
others. In order to unlock the riches promised by a comprehensive history, we
have to first build that history, one change at a time.

By now, you should have installed Git on your system, and so you are ready to
create your first Git repository.

A <dfn>repository</dfn> is the place where Git keeps track of all of the changes
for a given project. We need to create a repository for each project we want to
track with Git.

## The `git init` command

The `git init` command creates a new Git repository to keep track of changes to
the files in the directory where the command is run. For example:

```
$ cd projects/git-book
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/george/projects/git-book/.git/
```

This creates a new Git repository in the `projects/git-book` directory, telling
Git that from now on we want to track the changes made to one or more of the
files in that directory. Since we haven't told Git exactly which files to track
yet, the repository is empty; this is true even if the `projects/git-book`
directory isn't empty.

Running the command creates a new directory, `projects/git-book/.git`, where Git
will store the files that represent the repository. This is the <dfn>Git
directory</dfn>, whereas `projects/git-book` is the <dfn>working
directory</dfn>.

To begin with, we'll modify files in the working directory, just as we would if
we weren't using Git, and then tell Git to track the changes we've made in the
repository. As we get more advanced, we'll be able to conjure old or alternative
versions of our project from the repository, summoning them to the working
directory to do our bidding.

## The `git add` and `git commit` commands

The individual changes that make up the history of our project are called
<dfn>commits</dfn>. We commit changes to the Git repository in the same way we might
commit something to memory; once it's committed we won't lose it.

Each commit consists of a set of changes---like adding a new file, changing the
contents of a file, deleting a file, or changing the properties of the file in
some way---and a <dfn>commit message</dfn> that describes the changes, and the
name and email address of the commit's author.

Git provides a staging area called the <dfn>index</dfn>, where we build up a set
of changes before committing them to the repository. We'll come back to why the
index is useful later, but for now it's enough to know that creating a commit is
a three stage process:

1. Change files in the working directory.
2. Add some or all of those changes to the index.
3. Create a commit from the changes staged in the index.

Let's say we've created a file in our `git-book` working directory called
`chapter1.txt`, and we're happy with the contents of the file and want to commit
it to the repository. That's step one, step two is to add the file to the index
using the `git add` command:

```
$ git add chapter1.txt
```

And then we can create a commit using the `git commit` command:

```
$ git commit --message "Add first draft of chapter one"
[master (root-commit) adf6af9] Add first draft of chapter one
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 chapter1.txt
```

The commit message, passed using the `--message` argument, describes the changes
in the commit: in this case, it adds the first draft of chapter one.

By committing, we've drawn a line in the sand. Whatever changes we make to
chapter one in future, we'll always be able to get back to this
<dfn>revision</dfn> of the file. Even though a commit only contains the changes
made to a file since it was last committed, we can think of a commit as
representing a particular revision of our project, since Git is able to use all
of the commits up to that point to reconstruct the revision of the project that
existed when that commit was made.

Now that we've included it in a commit, the file `chapter1.txt` will be
<dfn>tracked</dfn> by Git: if we make any changes to the file in future, Git
will notice that it has changed and needs to be committed again.

## Summary

* Create a new Git repository with `git init`
* Stage related changes in the index with `git add`
* Commit the changes in the index with `git commit`

# Goal: Understand what is being tracked

So far, we've made simple commits with just one file, but in a complex project
there could be dozens or even hundreds of files. How do we know if they've been
changed since they were last committed, or if they're even tracked by Git?

In the last chapter we defined three important locations:

1. The working directory, where we keep and work on the current version of our
   project's files.
2. The index, where we build up a set of changes ready to commit.
3. The repository, where Git stores the history of our project as a series of
   commits.

Git provides a number of commands for comparing the state of the repository, the
index, and the working directory, so we can stay up to date with what's changed.

## The `git status` command

The `git status` command will tell us the status of our files. It lists all of
the changed or untracked files in the working directory, split into the
following groups:

1. **Changes to be committed**: files which have already been added to
   the index with `git add` and will be included the next time we run `git
   commit`.
2. **Changes not staged for commit**: files which have been changed in
   the working directory, but not added to the index.
3. **Untracked files**: files which have never been committed and
   therefore aren't tracked by Git.

For example:

```
$ git status
HEAD detached from eec7d91
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   chapter2.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   chapter1.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	chapter3.txt

```

In this case, `chapter2.txt` has just been added to the index for the first time
with `git add`, `chapter1.txt` is tracked by Git but has been modified since it
was last committed, and `chapter3.txt` isn't tracked by Git yet.

`git status` won't mention any files that haven't been changed since they were
last committed. If none of your files have changed, `git status` will let you
know that you have clean working directory:

```
$ git status
HEAD detached from eec7d91
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

 `git status` isn't concerned with the details of exactly what's
changed in each file, just which files have been changed and therefore could be
committed.

## The `git diff` command

Now we know which files in our working directory have changed, it would be good
to see the details of those changes. The `git diff` command provides this.

If you've used the Unix `diff` utility then the output of `git diff` might look
familiar, but while `diff` shows the difference between
files, `git diff` shows the difference between versions of the same file.

Without any arguments, `git diff` shows all changes that haven't been committed
or added to the index.

For example, here's what `chapter1.txt` the list time it was committed:

```
CHAPTER ONE

This is the first chapter, where it all begins.
```

Since that commit, we've modified `chapter1.txt` in the working directory to
look like this:

```
CHAPTER 1

This is the first chapter, where it all begins.
```

Running `git diff` shows us exactly what the differences are:

```
$ git diff
diff --git a/chapter1.txt b/chapter1.txt
index 1e41245..80a7940 100644
--- a/chapter1.txt
+++ b/chapter1.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
-CHAPTER ONE
+CHAPTER 1
 
 This is the first chapter, where it all begins.
```

The first section gives some information about the change Git is showing: which
versions are being compared, and on which lines of which files there are
changes. Other than the file's name, this is more useful to machines than
humans, and I usually don't read it carefully. More important are the changes
themselves:

```
-CHAPTER ONE
+CHAPTER 1
 
 This is the first chapter, where it all begins.
```

Lines beginning with a `-` indicate a line that has been removed, and lines
beginning with a `+` indicate a line that has been added. In this case a line
has been changed: the old version of the line was removed, and the new version
was added.

Lines beginning with a space---lines that lack both `+` and `-`---are
unchanged, but are shown to give the context of the change.

### The `git diff --staged` command

Remember that without any arguments `git diff` shows us the changes that haven't
been staged in the index yet. `git diff --staged` shows us the changes that
*have* been staged, but haven't yet been committed. In other words, `git diff
--staged` shows you the changes that would be included in the commit, if you
were to run `git commit` right now.

It can be useful to run `git diff --staged` before `git commit` as a final check
that the right changes have been staged in the index.

## Summary

* Look at the state of the working directory with `git status`
* Look at the changes since the latest commit with `git diff`
* Look at the contents of the index with `git diff --staged`

# Goal: Make beautiful commits

A good commit should contain a set of related changes, with a description of why
those changes were made. Much of the power of tracking history is lost if we
bundle lots of unrelated changes together in the same commit, or don't take the
time to describe them properly.

So far we've been assuming that all of the changes to a file belong in the same
commit. Real world work is rarely this neat and tidy, though. Perhaps we were
half way through changing a document, and found ourselves fixing an un-related
typing error; perhaps we forgot to commit a set of changes before moving on to
the next idea; perhaps we just got distracted: whatever the cause, a real
project's working directory can be a messy place.

This is where the index really comes into its own: By updating the index before
we commit, we can carefully select the changes that go into each commit; even
going so far as to split unrelated changes to the same file over several
commits.

## The `git add --patch` command

In addition to the name of a file, the `git add` command can take some
options to control exactly what is added to the index. Particularly useful is
the `--patch` option, which shows you each change in turn and lets you decide if
it should be added to the index or not.

Let's look at an example: I've made two changes to the same file but they are
unrelated, so I want to add them to the repository as two separate commits. `git
diff` tells me I have the following changes:

```
$ git diff
diff --git a/chapter1.txt b/chapter1.txt
index 8f6f18e..d119536 100644

```

On the first line, I've corrected a typing error by changing `fxo` to `fox`, and
then on the third line I've added some additional material about the dog's
reaction to the fox. `git add --patch` will allow us to go through each change
in turn, and decide if we want to add it to the index.

```
$ git add --patch

Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,s,e,?]? 

```

Git will show the changes---using the familiar style of `git diff`---one at a
time, and asks me what I want to do with each <dfn>hunk</dfn> with the question
`Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,s,e,?]?`. Most of the time we can answer with `y`
to add the change to the index, or `n` to ignore it for now and move on to the
next change. In this case, it's a little more complicated: since my changes are
very close together, Git's assumed that they're probably related and shows them
as a single hunk. I want to split up this hunk, and since I need something
beyond a basic "yes" or "no" I can use `?` to explain the other options:

```
Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,s,e,?]? ?
y - stage this hunk
n - do not stage this hunk
q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones
a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file

k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks
e - manually edit the current hunk
? - print help
```

After looking through my options, I see I can use `s` to tell Git that even
though these changes are close to each other they should be split up so that I
can treat them differently:

```
Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,s,e,?]? s

Git splits the change into two hunks, and shows me the first of them.
This change is just the correction on the first line, so I can stage it in the
index using `y`. Once it's staged, Git will show me the next change.
Since this change isn't related to the one I've already added to the index, I
don't want to include it in the same commit, so I can skip it with `n`:

I've now made a decision about each of the changes to the tracked files in my
working directory, so `git add --patch` exits, and I can commit the correction
that's staged, and then stage and commit the additional content:

```
$ git commit --message "Fix typing error"

I almost always use the `--patch` option when I'm adding files to the index,
even when I'm confident that all of the changes are related and will end up as a
single commit: It gives me the opportunity to review my changes, and has saved
me many times from committing something that wasn't quite right.

## Summary

* Good commits are focused on a set of related changes
* Use `git commit --patch` to add specific changes to the index

\part{Using history}

# Goal: Read the history

Now that we've made some commits, we can begin to use them to explore the
history of our project.

You'll often want to view your whole commit history. It can be a great way of
refreshing your memory about what you were working on, or seeing what others
have done on a collaborative project.

## The `git log` command

The `git log` command will show all of the commits, with their authors, dates,
and messages:

```
$ git log
commit 2a40e706eaf92805907a1f3be707a199982ef0f9
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 27 15:18:26 2014 -0400

    Draft content for chapter 2

commit c7d5d6876da96f8aff9b08416119ff0178d776cf
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 27 15:16:48 2014 -0400

    Draft content for chapter 1
```

In this example, the project has two commits. The most recent commit is shown
first.

Each commit starts with an long string of numbers and letters that uniquely
identifies the commit:

```
commit 2a40e706eaf92805907a1f3be707a199982ef0f9
```

These identifiers are very important. Many of the ways we can use our projects'
Git history involve referring to specific commits, and we often do that using
these unique identifiers.

Often the full output of `git log` is more than we need: a short summary of each
commit would be enough, without authors, dates, or even the full commit message.
The `git log` command accepts many options to customise the format of the
output; one of the most useful is `--oneline`, which only outputs the first line
of the commit message, and the first few characters of the unique identifier:

```
2a40e70 Draft content for chapter 2
c7d5d68 Draft content for chapter 1
```

Running `git help log` will give you comprehensive documentation on the other
ways you can customise the output of `git log`.

## The `git show` command

While `git log` gives us an overview of many commits, the `git show` command
will show the contents of a specific commit. We need to tell it which commit to
show; this is the first of many examples of a place where we can use a commit's
unique identifier.

```
$ git show c7d5d6876da96f8aff9b08416119ff0178d776cf
commit c7d5d6876da96f8aff9b08416119ff0178d776cf

index 0000000..b5689b5
--- /dev/null
+++ b/chapter1.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+Chapter 1: This is the first chapter.
```

The output should all be familiar: it starts with information about the commit,
which is very similar to the output produced by `git log`, and then shows the
changes made by the commit, which is very similar to the output produced by `git
diff`.

## Summary

* Use `git log` to see a list of commits.
* Use `git log --oneline` to see just the first line of the commit messages.
* Use `git show <identifier>` to see the contents of a specific commit.

# Goal: Refer to commits

In the last chapter we learnt how to use the `git log` command to find a
commit's identifier, which we could use with the `git show` command to view the
contents of that commit.

Commit identifiers can be quite cumbersome to use: they're long, complex, and
not very memorable. Fortunately, Git provides a range of alternatives.

Let's imagine the following Git history, and see how we can refer to the commits
without using the long-winded commit identifiers:

```
$ git log
commit e420911b9d16d0fd75a12a71202673ae32fc933a

    Second commit

Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 27 15:25:23 2014 -0400

    First commit
```

## Abbreviating commit identifiers

Let's say we want to look at the latest commit. What we've seen so far is `git
show` with the full identifier:

```
$ git show e420911b9d16d0fd75a12a71202673ae32fc933a
commit e420911b9d16d0fd75a12a71202673ae32fc933a
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 27 15:25:32 2014 -0400

    Third commit
```

In the previous chapter we saw that the `git log --oneline` command only prints
the start of the commit identifier. It does this because it's possible to use
the beginning of the identifier to identify a commit, as long as you use enough
of it to be unique among all of the commit identifiers in the repository. In
practice, this usually means that we can use the first 6 or 7 characters of the
identifier without any problems, even in a long running project with thousands
of commits.

```
$ git show e420911
commit e420911b9d16d0fd75a12a71202673ae32fc933a
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 27 15:25:32 2014 -0400

    Third commit
```

If you don't give enough characters to uniquely identify a single commit, Git
will let you know that you've provided an ambiguous argument:

```
$ git show e42
fatal: ambiguous argument 'e42': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'
```

## Relative commit references

Each commit in our Git repository has a <dfn>parent commit</dfn>: the
commit that immediately preceded it. If we know the identifier of a commit, we
can tell Git to give us its parent commit using a `~1` suffix. For example:

```
$ git show e420911~1
commit 25cece8870c50144c68b5fe27a03aeb647b28c4a
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 27 15:25:29 2014 -0400

    Second commit
```

By increasing the number after the `~` we can follow the parent relationships
back through the project's history. For example, `~2` will give us the parent of
the parent commit:

```
$ git show e420911~2
commit d8084d3fb7f9924dcefad1a20da885b1aba28d54
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 27 15:25:23 2014 -0400

    First commit
```

## Using the commit message

These techniques are all great if you know the commit's identifier, or at least
the identifier of one of its descendants, but identifiers aren't as memorable as
commit messages. Fortunately it's possible to refer to commits using a part of
their message, too:

```
$ git show :/Second
commit 25cece8870c50144c68b5fe27a03aeb647b28c4a
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 27 15:25:29 2014 -0400

    Second commit
```

If there are multiple commits that match the given word, then Git will pick the
newest matching commit.

## There are more!

We've only scratched the surface of the many ways of referring to Git commits.
If you want all the options, then Git's comprehensive help system is the place
to go:

    $ git help revisions

If you're reading this book in order to learn Git for the first time, then many
of the concepts in that document won't be familiar to you yet, but don't be
afraid to explore the documentation.

## Summary

* Use abbreviated commit identifiers.
* Use relative commit references, e.g. `e420911~2`.
* Refer to commits using their message, e.g. `:/Second`.
* Check `git help revisions` for more.

# Goal: Understand a change

Now that we've learnt how to look at the whole history, and a variety of ways to
refer to a specific commit, we're ready to start asking more demanding questions
of our Git repository.

It can often be the case in a long running project that we come across something
in one of our files that doesn't quite make sense. Using the project's Git
history to see where something came from can help to make it more clear. Git can
help us answer questions like "why was this changed?" and "what was here before
it changed?"

Here's a confusing file called `chapter1.txt`. Let's dig into the history and
see if we can work out what's going on:

```
There are several things you should know:
Lastly, Git will help you get your work done.
```

It looks like there should be a list here, but there's only one item, and
confusingly it seems like it should be the last item. Maybe this just needs to
be rephrased, but maybe something was deleted that shouldn't have been.

## The `git blame` command

The first command we can use to understand this file is `git blame`, which will
tell us which person, and more importantly which commit, is to blame for the
current state of each line in the file:

```
HEAD is now at aaad9ad... Remove contradictory information.
$ git blame chapter1.txt
^61966bf (George Brocklehurst 2014-10-23 11:21:55 -0400 1) There are several things you should know:
^61966bf (George Brocklehurst 2014-10-23 11:21:55 -0400 2) Lastly, Git will help you get your work done.
```

Each line of the file is printed with some annotations: the abbreviated
identifier of the commit in which it was last changed, the author and date of
that commit, and the line number.

In this case, both of those lines were last changed in the commit `61966bf`. The
next step in our investigation should probably be to look at that commit and see
the full change:

```
$ git show 61966bf
commit 61966bf14e754946d0ab3a6d8e66c419918c15a8
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 23 11:21:55 2014 -0400

+There are several things you should know:

```

This is a clue on the road to solving this mystery: we now know that the
ambiguous section started as a list, but a couple of items were subsequently
removed. It's a good start, but we still don't know why the list was altered.
Maybe the correct fix is to rephrase the content, but maybe those list items
should never have been removed in the first place.

To find out where the list items went, we can turn to another command we've used
before: `git log`.

## Filtering `git log` by commit and file name

We've used `git log` to look at all of the commits in our project. In this case,
we want something more specific. The `git log` command accepts a range of
commits and a file path as arguments, which we can use to only see commits that:

1. happened *after* the list was first introduced in commit `61966bf`, and
2. contain changes to the file `chapter1.txt`.

The most common way to refer to a range of commits is `first..last`, where
`first` and `last` both refer to commits, using their identifiers, or one of the
other methods we've seen of identifying a commit. Git also allows us to omit
the end of the range, assuming when we do so that we mean it to end with the
most recent commit. In our case, we want to see everything after commit
`61966bf`, which introduced the list, so we can use the range `61966bf..`.

Putting this together with the file path `chapter1.txt`, we get this command:

```
$ git log 61966bf.. chapter1.txt
commit aaad9ad5001689eeaeca0ef88626debd27801aea
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 23 11:22:31 2014 -0400

    Remove contradictory information.
```

Our carefully filtered log tells us that only one commit touched the file we're
interested in during the time we're interested in. Let's take a closer look:

```
$ git show aaad9ad
commit aaad9ad5001689eeaeca0ef88626debd27801aea
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 23 11:22:31 2014 -0400

    Remove contradictory information.

```

Finally we have the full context of this confusing file. It started out as a
list, but a couple of items were removed because they were contradictory, which
left the surrounding content in a confusing state. Now that we have the full
story, we can confidently fix the problem.

Not every investigation will follow these steps, but if you understand the
commands we've used here you should be able to track down the source of all
kinds of problems.

## Summary

* Use `git blame <file>` to find out which commit last changed the lines in a file.
* Use `git log <range> <file>` to see relevant commits.

# Goal: Search the repository

In the last chapter, we saw how to filter the output of `git log` to only show
us commits in a certain range, or commits that contain changes to certain files,
so we could see what changes had been made. In this chapter we'll start from the
other side: we know the change we're interested in, but we don't know when or
where it happened.

Git provides some powerful search tools which let us search through the files
it is tracking and the commits we've made in the past.

## Filtering `git log` by content

Let's pretend I'm writing a novel, which has the following Git history:

```
$ git log --oneline
2ba40c1 Remove cafe scene and references
e8393d4 Refer back to the cafe in chapter 2.
1dba13c Add cafe scene
3ba3f98 Remove zoo scene
0e6d7f7 Begin work on chapter 2
597b543 Begin work on chapter 1
```

I deleted a section of the novel, but I'm having second thoughts: I think the
story will flow better if I put it back. Unfortunately, I deleted it some time
ago, and I don't remember all of the details, just that it centred around a
character called Alice.

There are a few commit messages that mention removing content, but by filtering
the commit log to only show commits which contain changes that add or remove the
word "Alice", I can narrow down my search.  We do this using `git log`'s `-S`
option:

```
$ git log --oneline -S Alice
3ba3f98 Remove zoo scene
0e6d7f7 Begin work on chapter 2
597b543 Begin work on chapter 1
```

Now I've narrowed down the search to three commits, and only one of the
messages mentions removing content, so it looks like I've found my deleted
scene.

```
$ git show 3ba3f98
commit 3ba3f9832331a486d8aeabe6215b3abaa1dfc052
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>

@@ -1,4 +1,3 @@
 CHAPTER TWO
 
-Alice and Bob went to the zoo. Alice enjoyed learning about the different
-animals, while Bob mostly just enjoyed eating icecream.
+We all know that Bob likes icecream.
```

The `-S` option can be combined with the other filtering techniques we've seen,
so if I had remembered the file that contained the change, or the range of
commits it was part of, I could have narrowed down the search even further.

You can think of filtering the `git log` as searching in time: Given its
knowledge of the history of your project, you're asking Git to tell you about
times when certain kinds of changes were made. It's also useful to be able to
search in space: given a fixed point in time---in Git's terminology, a specific
revision of the project---where does a certain word or phrase appear in the
project's tracked files?

## The `git grep` command

The `git grep` command searches through all of the tracked files for a
particular word or phrase. If you're familiar with the Unix `grep` utility,
you'll find that `git grep` works in much the same way.

Let's say we want to find all references to Alice in all of the tracked files in
the working directory. We can use `git grep`:

```
$ git grep Alice
chapter1.txt:There were once two people called Alice and Bob.
```

This tells me that Alice is currently only mentioned once, in the file
`chapter1.txt`. I know that the commit `3ba3f98` removed some mentions of
Alice---we just used the `git log -S` command to find it---and I want to find out
how often she was mentioned before that commit.

If you've read the chapter on how to "Refer to commits", you'll know that if we
have the ID of a commit, we can use a `~1` suffix to reference the commit before
that commit. In this case, we're interested in the revision before `3ba3f98`, so
we can use `3ba3f98~1`.

The `git grep` command can take a commit as a second argument, which tells it to
search the particular revision of our project represented by that commit:

```
$ git grep Alice 3ba3f98~1
3ba3f98~1:chapter1.txt:There were once two people called Alice and Bob.
3ba3f98~1:chapter2.txt:Alice and Bob went to the zoo. Alice enjoyed learning about the different
```

I've found my answer: Alice used to be mentioned in `chapter1.txt` and
`chapter2.txt`.

`git grep` can match more than just simple words and phrases: it supports a
powerful pattern matching language called Regular Expressions, which means you
can search for things like "any two digit number", or "either the word 'Alice'
or the word 'Bob'". How to write regular expressions is beyond the scope of this
book, but there is plenty of information on the Web, and even whole books on the
topic.

## Summary

* Find commits that mention a word or phrase with `git log -S <word>`.
* Find tracked files that mention a word or phrase with `git grep <word>`.
* Search previous revisions with `git grep <word> <revision>`.

# Goal: Undo changes

In the previous chapter, we saw how to use Git's search tools to find a change
we were having second thoughts about. Having found the commit, how can we
reverse that change? We could use `git show` to view the changes it introduced
and manually unpick them by typing them out again or using copy-and-paste. That
would be a lot of manual, error-prone work, and fortunately Git provides tools
to undo changes we'd rather hadn't been committed.

## The `git revert` command

The simplest way of undoing the changes in a commit is to use the `git revert`
command. This command creates a new commit which contains the opposite set of
changes to the commit we want to undo: if a line was added in the original
commit, it will be removed in the new commit, and vice versa.

Here is the commit we identified in the previous chapter:

```
$ git show 3ba3f98
commit 3ba3f9832331a486d8aeabe6215b3abaa1dfc052
Author: George Brocklehurst <george@georgebrock.com>

 CHAPTER TWO
 
-Alice and Bob went to the zoo. Alice enjoyed learning about the different
-animals, while Bob mostly just enjoyed eating icecream.
+We all know that Bob likes icecream.
```

When we pass the commit's identifier as an argument to the `git revert` command,
Git will construct the opposite set of changes, and commit them.

```
$ git revert 3ba3f98
[master 282faf2] Revert "Remove zoo scene"
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Notice that the output of the `git revert` command contains the identifier of
the new commit.

```

Like the `git commit` command, `git revert` will open a text editor so that we
can write a description of the commit, but unlike `git commit` it helpfully
provides a default commit message with some information about the commit that is
being reverted. It's usually a good idea to leave the default message
intact---so that you'll be able to recognise a revert commit when you're reading
the history---and to add a note to the end to explain *why* it was useful to
revert this commit.

## The `git reset` command

While `git revert` is useful for undoing a commit from somewhere back in the
distant history of the project, we have other options if we want to undo our
most recent commit or commits.

The `git reset` command will reset the repository back to an earlier state. It's
a flexible command that can be used in various ways; we'll see it again later in
the book, but for now let's focus on two uses:

1. To remove changes from the index: they will still exist in the working
   directory, but they won't be included in the next commit.
2. To remove the last commit or commits from the repository: the commit's
   changes will still exist in the working directory, but it will be as if they
   were never committed.

### Remove changes from the index

Without any arguments, `git reset` will clear the index without changing the
working directory or repository: it undoes the `git add` command. This kind of
reset is useful when you're staging some changes, but you realise that you're
not really ready to commit them yet, or that you've staged the wrong changes.

Continuing with my novel, I've made some changes to `chapter1.txt` that I think
are ready to commit, so I add them to the index, and `git status` shows that
they are staged to commit:

```
$ git add chapter1.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   chapter1.txt

```

I was about to commit, but I've changed my mind: these changes aren't all
related, and it would probably be better to split them up over multiple commits.
I can remove them from the index using `git reset`:

```
$ git reset
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	chapter1.txt
```

`git status` confirms that `chapter1.txt` has still been changed, but is no
longer staged to commit:

```
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   chapter1.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

### Remove commits from the repository

When it's given a commit as an argument, `git reset` will clear the index, and
roll the repository back to that revision, as if the subsequent commits had
never happened. It won't change the working directory, so the current state of
our files won't be lost, but the history of how we got to that state will be.

This kind of reset is useful when you realise that your last commit was too big,
and you'd like to break it down as several smaller commits. Or maybe you realise
that the changes in your last two commits would make more sense spread across
three commits.

Although undoing commits is useful, it should make us a little uncomfortable.
Commits are the record of how our project has changed, and if we undo them
there's a very real chance that we'll lose some valuable history along the way.
Over the last few chapters we've seen a few of the ways that having access to a
project's history can help us; hopefully we've seen enough that the idea of
throwing part of the history away gives us pause.

Let's see how this works with a real example: I want to undo the last two
commits to my novel. First, to refresh our memory, let's look at what those
commits contain:

```
$ git log --oneline
2ba40c1 Remove cafe scene and references
e8393d4 Refer back to the cafe in chapter 2.
1dba13c Add cafe scene
3ba3f98 Remove zoo scene
0e6d7f7 Begin work on chapter 2
597b543 Begin work on chapter 1
```

Remember that `git log` shows the most recent commit first, so I'm trying to
undo `e8393d4` and `2ba40c1`. The first of these commits adds some information
about what Bob does at the cafe:

```
$ git show e8393d4

In order to undo these commits, I need to reset the repository to the last
revision before they were made: `1dba13c`.

```
$ git reset 1dba13c
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	chapter1.txt
```

This doesn't change the working directory, but I have lost some information in
the process. Let's look at the state of the repository after I reset:

```
$ git log --oneline
1dba13c Add cafe scene
3ba3f98 Remove zoo scene
0e6d7f7 Begin work on chapter 2
597b543 Begin work on chapter 1
```

The log looks good: the two commits we wanted to undo are gone. How about the
working directory?

```
$ git status

  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

```

The status looks OK, too: there are some uncommitted changes in the working
directory, but the commits we just removed made changes to both `chapter1.txt`
and `chapter2.txt`, and yet our working directory only has changes to
`chapter1.txt`:

```
$ git diff

```

The changes to `chapter2.txt` in our two deleted commits cancelled each other
out: the first commit added a sentence about what Bob did at the cafe, and the
second took it away again. By using `git reset` to remove these two commits,
we've lost a potentially useful bit of history; there's no longer any record
that this sentence ever existed, which means we no longer have the option of
recovering it if we change our minds.  Equally importantly, the information
associated with the two commits is gone too: we no longer know who made those
commits, when, or why.

`git reset` is a useful tool, but it should be used with caution, and is least
risky when used to undo a single commit immediately after it was made. Git is a
powerful tool, and will often give us more than enough rope to hang ourselves.
