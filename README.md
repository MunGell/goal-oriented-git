# Goal-oriented Git

We use Git for a reason: to safely store the history of our documents.
This practical book will teach you how to record the changes you make to
your files, and how to use that record as a powerful tool for
collaboration and problem solving.

## Getting the latest version

You'll find the latest version of the book in the [release directory].

## Building the book

Most readers shouldn't need to build the book from source. These instructions
are for the authors and maintainers.

Building the book requires [docker] and [paperback] to be set up; follow the
instructions in the [paperback README]. Once they're up and running, you can
just run `make`.
