# About this book

If you want to learn how to use Git without worrying too much about what's going
on under the hood, then this book is for you.

Every chapter will take something that Git can do for you---from tracking
changes, to searching your files, to collaborating with others---and explain
practically how to achieve that goal. We won't cover everything Git can do, but
we won't just stick to the basics either: the goal of this book is to teach you
a working set of Git commands that can get you through most day-to-day
situations.

If you're learning Git for the first time, I'd recommend reading through in
order: When we look at a particular goal, I'll assume knowledge of commands that
were covered in earlier chapters.
