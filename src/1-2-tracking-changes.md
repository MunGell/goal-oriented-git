# Goal: Tracking changes

If you can see and understand the incremental changes to your files that
led to their current state, then you have a better chance of fully understanding
the project you are working on, fixing problems that arise, and collaborating
successfully with others. In order to unlock the riches promised by a
comprehensive history, we have to first build that history, one change
at a time.

By now, you should have installed Git on your system, and so you are ready to
create your first Git <dfn>repository</dfn>, the place where Git keeps track of
all of the changes for a given project.

## The `git init` command

The `git init` command creates a new Git repository in the directory where the
command is run. For example:

`# cd examples/1-2-tracking-changes
`# rm -rf projects/git-book/.git
`$ cd projects/git-book
`$ git init

This creates a new Git repository in the `projects/git-book` directory,
essentially telling Git that from now on we want to track the changes made to
files in that directory. Since we haven't told Git exactly
which files to track yet, the repository is empty; this is true even if the
`projects/git-book` directory isn't empty.

Running the command creates a new directory, `projects/git-book/.git`, where Git
will store all of the files it needs to track our changes. This is the <dfn>Git
directory</dfn>, whereas `projects/git-book` is the <dfn>working directory</dfn>.

To begin with, we'll modify files in the working directory and tell Git to track
the changes we've made. As we get more advanced, we'll be able to conjure old or
alternative versions of our project from the Git directory, summoning them to
the working directory to do our bidding.

## The `git add` and `git commit` commands

The individual changes that make up the history of our project are called
<dfn>commits</dfn>. We commit changes to the Git repository in the same way we might
commit something to memory; once it's committed we won't lose it.

Each commit consists of a set of changes -- like adding a new file,
changing the contents of a file, deleting a file, or changing the properties of
the file in some way -- and a <dfn>commit message</dfn> that describes the changes.

Git provides a staging area called the <dfn>index</dfn>, where we build up a set of
changes before committing them to the repository. We'll come back to why the
index is useful later, but for now it's enough to know that creating a commit is
a three stage process:

1. Change files in the working directory.
2. Add some or all of those changes to the index.
3. Create a commit from the changes staged in the index.

Let's say we've created a file in our `git-book` working directory called
`chapter1.txt`, and we're happy with the contents of the file and want to commit
it to the repository. That's step one, step two is to add the file to the index
using the `git add` command:

`# cd examples/1-2-tracking-changes/projects/git-book
`$ git add chapter1.txt

And then we can create a commit using the `git commit` command:

`# cd examples/1-2-tracking-changes/projects/git-book
`$ git commit --message "Add first draft of chapter one"

The commit message, passed using the `--message` argument, describes the changes
in the commit: in this case, it adds the first draft of chapter one.

By committing, we've drawn a line in the sand. Whatever changes we make to
chapter one in future, we'll always be able to get back to the
<dfn>revision</dfn> we just committed.

Now that we've included it in a commit, the file `chapter1.txt` will be
<dfn>tracked</dfn> by Git: if we make any changes to the file in future, Git
will notice that it has changed and needs to be committed again.

## Summary

* Create a new Git repository with `git init`
* Stage related changes in the index with `git add`
* Commit the changes in the index with `git commit`
